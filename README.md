# module9Assignment. It was a toughest assignment I've ever done! It was so challanging to do the css part as far I was totally new.
I had to try a lot to make this normal type css design. All the ideas I applied in the assignment is totally from my head. 
All the blogs I used in the assignment is my personal blogs. I wrote them several times. 
Finally, I don't know how much I've done in the assignment. I've tried my best to apply all my knowledge in the assignment to be done. Hope will get a good feedback!
